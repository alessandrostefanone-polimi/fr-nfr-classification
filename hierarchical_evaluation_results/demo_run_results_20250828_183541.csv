The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.,NFR,0.95,PE,1.0,NFR_PE,"FR/NFR: This is a performance efficiency requirement that specifies HOW WELL the system must perform (response time) rather than WHAT it must do. It falls under the ISO/IEC 25010 Performance Efficiency characteristic, containing a specific measurable time constraint. | NFR Subclass: This requirement specifies a response time constraint, which directly relates to system performance characteristics by defining a specific time limit for query response under load conditions.",5.155701637268066,"{'nfr_key_indicators': ['respond', '2 seconds', 'load conditions'], 'nfr_processing_time': 1.9593262672424316}","respond, 2 seconds, load conditions",1.9593262672424316
All user authentication must use multi-factor authentication with encrypted tokens.,NFR,0.95,SE,0.95,NFR_SE,"FR/NFR: This is a security requirement specifying how authentication should be implemented (using MFA and encryption), rather than what the system does. It falls under the ISO/IEC 25010 Security characteristic, defining security mechanisms and constraints. | NFR Subclass: This requirement specifies authentication mechanisms and encryption for security, focusing on protecting user access through multi-factor authentication and token encryption.",5.859943389892578,"{'nfr_key_indicators': ['authentication', 'multi-factor', 'encrypted tokens', 'security'], 'nfr_processing_time': 1.9800262451171875}","authentication, multi-factor, encrypted tokens, security",1.9800262451171875
The user interface shall be intuitive for users with minimal training required.,NFR,0.95,US,0.95,NFR_US,"FR/NFR: This is a usability requirement that specifies HOW WELL the interface should perform rather than WHAT it should do. It relates to the ISO/IEC 25010 Usability characteristic, specifically addressing learnability and ease of use. The requirement describes a quality attribute of the system rather than a specific function. | NFR Subclass: This requirement focuses on user interface design, ease of use, and user experience characteristics, which are core aspects of usability.",4.8998122215271,"{'nfr_key_indicators': ['user interface', 'intuitive', 'minimal training'], 'nfr_processing_time': 2.0288028717041016}","user interface, intuitive, minimal training",2.0288028717041016
