The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.,NFR,0.95,UNKNOWN,0.0,NFR_UNKNOWN,"FR/NFR: This is a performance efficiency requirement specifying response time constraints. It defines HOW WELL the system must perform rather than WHAT it must do. It falls under the ISO/IEC 25010 Performance Efficiency characteristic, with specific measurable criteria (2 seconds). | NFR Subclass: Error during classification: type object 'NFRSubclassificationPrompt' has no attribute 'model_json_schema'",5.726330995559692,"{'nfr_key_indicators': [], 'nfr_processing_time': 0.0}",,0.0
All user authentication must use multi-factor authentication with encrypted tokens.,NFR,0.95,UNKNOWN,0.0,NFR_UNKNOWN,"FR/NFR: This is a security requirement specifying how authentication should be implemented (using MFA and encryption), rather than what the system does. It falls under the ISO/IEC 25010 Security characteristic, defining security mechanisms and constraints. | NFR Subclass: Error during classification: type object 'NFRSubclassificationPrompt' has no attribute 'model_json_schema'",6.4974095821380615,"{'nfr_key_indicators': [], 'nfr_processing_time': 0.0}",,0.0
The user interface shall be intuitive for users with minimal training required.,NFR,0.95,UNKNOWN,0.0,NFR_UNKNOWN,"FR/NFR: This is a usability requirement that specifies HOW WELL the interface should perform rather than WHAT it should do. It relates to the ISO/IEC 25010 Usability characteristic, specifically addressing learnability and ease of use. The requirement focuses on quality attributes rather than specific functionality. | NFR Subclass: Error during classification: type object 'NFRSubclassificationPrompt' has no attribute 'model_json_schema'",4.4746668338775635,"{'nfr_key_indicators': [], 'nfr_processing_time': 0.0}",,0.0
