### LLM Results (Current Evaluation)

| Model Configuration | F1-Score | Precision | Recall | Accuracy | Few-Shot |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| DeepSeek R1 (Few-Shot) | 0.921 | 0.924 | 0.920 | 0.920 | Yes |


## Analysis

### Performance Comparison
- **Best LLM Performance:** 0.921 F1-Score (DeepSeek R1 (Few-Shot))
- **Best BERT Performance:** 0.850 F1-Score (SciBERT)
- **Difference:** +0.071 (+8.3% change)

### Key Observations

1. **Classification Approach:** LLMs use natural language understanding and few-shot learning, while BERT models require fine-tuning on domain-specific data.

2. **Interpretability:** LLM classifications include reasoning and key indicators, providing explainable results compared to BERT's black-box approach.

3. **Flexibility:** LLMs can adapt to new domains without retraining, while BERT models require Task-Adaptive Pre-Training (TAPT) for optimal performance.

4. **Resource Requirements:** LLMs require API access or local deployment, while BERT models need training infrastructure and domain-specific datasets.

## Methodology

### Classification Rules
The evaluation used comprehensive classification rules derived from:
- ISO/IEC 25010:2023 quality characteristics
- IEEE Requirements Engineering standards
- Linguistic patterns identified in academic literature

### Functional Requirements (FR) Indicators:
- Action verbs: perform, execute, calculate, process, display, store
- Behavioral descriptions: "system shall", "must execute"
- Data manipulation operations

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Indicators:
- Quality attributes: performance, security, usability, reliability
- Constraints: time limits, resource constraints, compliance requirements
- ISO/IEC 25010 characteristics: efficiency, maintainability, portability

## Implications for Practice

### When to Use LLMs:
- **Exploratory analysis** of new requirement documents
- **Rapid classification** without training data
- **Explainable results** needed for stakeholder communication
- **Cross-domain** requirements analysis

### When to Use BERT:
- **High-volume production** classification
- **Domain-specific optimization** with available training data
- **Consistent performance** requirements
- **Resource-constrained** environments

## Limitations

1. **Sample Size:** Evaluation based on limited dataset samples
2. **Domain Specificity:** Results may vary for different engineering domains
3. **Cost Considerations:** LLM API costs vs. BERT training costs not evaluated
4. **Temporal Stability:** LLM performance may vary with model updates

## Recommendations

1. **Hybrid Approach:** Use LLMs for initial classification and explanation, BERT for high-volume production
2. **Domain Adaptation:** Develop domain-specific prompts for specialized engineering fields
3. **Continuous Evaluation:** Regular assessment as both LLM and BERT models evolve
4. **Tool Integration:** Incorporate both approaches in requirements management tools
