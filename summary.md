# FR/NFR Classification Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive AI workflow for classifying technical requirements into Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) using Large Language Models, with performance comparison against BERT baselines from academic literature.

- **Quality:** Professional requirements with binary FR/NFR labels

### 4. Comprehensive Evaluation Framework ‚úÖ
**File:** `comprehensive_evaluation.py`

**BERT Baseline Comparison:**
Based on Table 4-10 from Lim (2022):
- BERT Base: 83.8% F1-Score
- RoBERTa Base: 82.6% F1-Score
- SciBERT: 85.0% F1-Score (best BERT performance)
- Task-Adaptive Pre-Training (TAPT) variants: 83.6-84.4% F1-Score

**Files:** `setup_and_requirements.py`, `README.md`, `example_usage.py`

**Complete Setup Package:**

## üî¨ Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Academic Rigor
- **Proper Citation:** All sources properly cited with specific references
- **Reproducible Methodology:** Based on established academic standards
- **Comparative Analysis:** Direct comparison with published BERT baselines
- **Standards Compliance:** Aligned with ISO/IEC 25010:2023 and IEEE standards

### 2. Classification Rule Framework

**Functional Requirements (FR) Rules:**
```
- Define WHAT the system must do
- Action verbs: perform, execute, calculate, process, display, store
- Linguistic patterns: "shall perform", "must execute", "will process"
- Behavioral descriptions and data manipulation operations
```

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Rules:**
```
- Define HOW WELL the system performs
- ISO/IEC 25010 quality characteristics:
  * Performance Efficiency (time, resources, capacity)
  * Reliability (availability, fault tolerance)
  * Security (confidentiality, integrity, authentication)
  * Usability (learnability, operability, accessibility)
  * Maintainability (modularity, testability)
  * Portability (adaptability, installability)
  * Compatibility (interoperability, co-existence)
- Constraint patterns: "within X seconds", "99.9% uptime"
```

### 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering

**Few-Shot Template Example:**
```
Classification Examples:

Example 1: "The system shall calculate monthly payment..." ‚Üí FR
Reasoning: Describes specific calculation function with action verb "calculate"

Example 2: "System shall respond within 2 seconds" ‚Üí NFR  
Reasoning: Performance constraint (ISO/IEC 25010 Performance Efficiency)

[Additional examples with detailed reasoning...]
```

### 4. Multi-Model Architecture

**Supported Models:**
- **Cloud:** Claude-3 Sonnet, Claude-3 Haiku, Claude-3 Opus
- **Local:** Llama 3.1, Mistral 7B, Qwen2, any Ollama-supported model
- **Flexible Configuration:** Easy switching between models and prompting strategies

## üìä Expected Performance Analysis

### Advantages Over BERT Models

1. **No Training Required:** LLMs work out-of-the-box without domain-specific training
2. **Explainable Results:** Provides reasoning and key indicators for each classification
3. **Flexibility:** Adapts to new domains without retraining
4. **Few-Shot Learning:** Leverages examples in prompts rather than requiring large training datasets
5. **Interpretability:** Stakeholders can understand classification decisions

### BERT Model Advantages

1. **Consistent Performance:** Stable results after proper training
2. **Lower Inference Cost:** No API costs after initial training investment
3. **Domain Optimization:** Task-Adaptive Pre-Training (TAPT) optimizes for specific domains
4. **Proven Results:** Demonstrated 85% F1-Score with SciBERT
